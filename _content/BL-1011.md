Debugging. Something that programmers try hard to avoid, only to make more bugs in code. Coding without bugs is something even the best programmers would find hard. Which is why, you should always debug code. And one of the best ways to debug JavaScript code is the amazing console.log(). Except, there are better ways.And that is the point of this article. To tell about better ways to interact with the console. Typing console in a sophisticated IDE gives a variety of auto completions.

Instead of using the normal ```console.log()```, here are some better options. Using these makes the process of debugging a lot easier and faster.  ```console.warn()``` and ```console.error()``` When there is a bug that can stop the working of your application, using another console.log to debug it wouldn’t work. Your console messages would get mixed up. You can’t find the message that your looking for. But, using console.warn() and console.error() are good ways to overcome this.
